## 🔒 Security Notice

**⚠️ Never use your actual Gmail password in this program.**

Google blocks normal account passwords from being used in third-party applications for security reasons. Using your real password can also put your account at risk if the code is shared or leaked.

Instead, you must use a **Gmail App Password**. App passwords are special 16-character keys generated by Google that allow apps and scripts to send emails securely without exposing your main account password.

### ✅ Why Use App Passwords?
- Keeps your main Gmail account safe  
- Can be revoked anytime  
- Designed specifically for automation and third-party apps  

### 🔑 How To Create an App Password
1. Enable **2-Step Verification** in your Google Account  
2. Go to **App Passwords** in Security Settings  
3. Select **Mail** and generate password  
4. Use that password in the program  

---

⚠️ Never upload or share your app password publicly. If it gets exposed, delete it immediately and generate a new one.
